[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4291093.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4291093)

Unzips an assembly graph using Hi-C data and/or long reads and/or linked reads. This branch is the master branch, use the article branch to reproduce the results of the article.

## Why use GraphUnzip ?

`GraphUnzip` improves the contiguity of an assembly and duplicates collapsed homozygous contigs, aiming at reconstituting an assembly with haplotypes assembled separately. `GraphUnzip` untangles an uncollapsed assembly graph in GFA format. Its naive approach makes no assumption on the ploidy or the heterozygosity rate of the organism and thus can be used on highly heterozygous genomes or metagenomes. If you want to know when GraphUnzip may be useful to you, take a look at [when is GraphUnzip useful](#usefulness) below.

Combined with a short read assembler, `GraphUnzip` makes a great hybrid (short/long read) assembler: go to the [bottom of the page](#hybridUnzip) to see an example.

## Installation

`GraphUnzip` requires python3 with numpy, scipy and zlib. 
To read bam-format data (Hi-C or linked reads) you'll also need pysam.

There are 4 options available for installing GraphUnzip:

1) Clone from this repository and install as a local Python package.
This is the best way to ensure you have the latest development version.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nadegeguiglielmoni/GraphUnzip.git && cd graphunzip && pip install -e .
```

2) Pip install directly from this git repository.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nadegeguiglielmoni/GraphUnzip.git
```

3) Install from PyPi.

```bash
pip install graphunzip
```


Run `graphunzip --help` to verify installation.


## Usage

### Input

`GraphUnzip` needs two things to work :

An assembly graph in [GFA 1.0 format](https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec) and any combination of :

1. Hi-C data : GraphUnzip needs either 1) the Hi-C reads mapped to the assembly in name-sorted bam format or 2) a sparse contact matrix and a fragment list using the [formats outputted by hicstuff](https://github.com/koszullab/hicstuff#File-formats). You can use e.g. bwa to obtain these files:

```bash
awk '/^S/{print ">"$2"\n"$3}' assembly.gfa > assembly.fasta  		#produce a fasta file from the gfa
bwa index assembly.fasta
bwa mem -5SP -t 16 assembly.fasta /path/to/reads_1.fq /path/to/reads_2.fq | samtools view - -@ 16 -S -h -b -F 3340 | samtools sort -n > mapped.bam
```
and/or

2. Long reads (mapped to the GFA in the GAF format of [GraphAligner](https://github.com/maickrau/GraphAligner)). The best is to use an old version of GraphAligner (commit `5217838b436fee4eda5824aabee99406db2a137b`) with option `--global-alginment`, otherwise you can use a more recent version with option `--multimap-score-fraction 1`.

```bash
GraphAligner --global-alignment -x vg -f reads.fq -g graph.gfa -a longreads_aligned_on_gfa.gaf
``` 
and/or

3. Barcoded linked reads mapped to the contigs of the assembly in [SAM format](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf). Barcodes need to be designated in the SAM by a BX:Z: tag (e.g. BX:Z:AACTTGTCGGTCAT-1) at the end of each line. A possible pipeline to get this file from barcoded reads using BWA would be:

```bash
awk '/^S/{print ">"$2"\n"$3}' assembly.gfa > assembly.fasta  		#produce a fasta file from the gfa
bwa index assembly.fasta							#index the fasta file of the assembly
bwa mem assembly barcoded_reads.fastq -C > reads_aligned_on_assembly.sam	#align the barcoded reads to the assembly : the -C option is very important here, to keep the barcodes in the sam file
```

Note: Linked reads support is an experimental option we added on demand from some users. It has not been extensively tested. We also expect results to be poorer than what is obtained using Hi-C or long reads.

### Running GraphUnzip

To use `GraphUnzip`, you generally need to proceed in two steps :

1. If using Hi-C or linked reads, build interaction matrix(ces) (a matrix quantifying the pairwise interaction between all contigs): for that use the `HiC-IM`, or `linked-reads-IM` command, depending on which type of data you dispose. You will have to specify the files to which these interaction matrices will be written.

```bash
#for Hi-C
graphunzip HiC-IM -b mapped.bam -g assembly.gfa --HiC_IM hic_interactionmatrix.txt

#for linked reads
graphunzip linked-reads-IM --barcoded_SAM reads_aligned_on_assembly.sam -g assembly.gfa --linked_reads_IM linkedreads_interactionmatrix.txt
```

2. Use the command `unzip` to unzip the graph using the interaction matrices built beforehand and/or the gaf file if using long reads.

```bash
#let's unzip our gfa using linked-reads, Hi-C and long reads :

graphunzip unzip -g assembly.gfa -i hic_interactionmatrix.txt -k linkedreads_interactionmatrix.txt -l longreads_aligned_on_gfa.gaf -o assembly_unzipped.gfa

```


### Options

GraphUnzip has 3 sub-modules:  
- unzip: untangle the GFA file
- HiC-IM: to prepare Hi-C data
- linked-reads-IM: to prepare linked reads data

```

  -n, --noisy           (Hi-C only) Use this option if you expect that the assembly may contain artefactual contigs, e.g. when you use the .p_utg.gfa of hifiasm
  -e, --exhaustive      (long reads only) All links not found in the .gaf will be removed

Other options:
  -v, --verbose
  -r, --dont_rename     Use if you don't want to name the resulting supercontigs with short names but want to keep the names of the original contigs

## Hybrid assembly

Combined with a short read assembler, GraphUnzip makes a great hybrid (short reads - long reads) assembler. Here is a suggested pipeline.

### Intallation

You'll need a working python installation to run this pipeline.

If not already done, download GraphUnzip:
`git clone https://github.com/nadegeguiglielmoni/GraphUnzip.git`

Install [SPAdes](github.com/ablab/spades) to have both a short read assembler and an aligner (SPAligner). You can use another assembler if you prefer, but the installation of SPAdes is still recommended to have access to SPAligner. On Linux, the commands are:
```
wget http://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.15.3/SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux.tar.gz
tar -xzf SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux.tar.gz
```
### Short read assembly
 
Run the short read assembler. If you are using SPAdes,
```
SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/bin/spades.py --s short_reads.fastq -o short_read_assembly 
```
This is in case the short reads are unpaired. If using another type of library or if you want to tune other options, please refer to `spades.py --help`.

### Read alignment

We will use SPAligner to align long reads to the assembly graph. If you want to tune the parameters, refer to the [gitHub of SPAligner](https://github.com/ablab/spades/tree/spades_3.15.3/assembler/src/projects/spaligner).
```
SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/bin/spaligner SPAdes-3.15.3-Linux/share/spaligner/spaligner_config.yaml -d pacbio -g short_read_assembly/assembly_graph_with_scaffolds.gfa -k 127 -s long_reads.fastq.gz
```

### Untangling the short-read assembly

Now we use GraphUnzip:
```
GraphUnzip/graphunzip -g short_read_assembly/assembly_graph_with_scaffolds.gfa -l spaligner_result/alignment.tsv -o assembly.gfa -f assembly.fasta
```

The final assembly are assembly.gfa (GFA format) and assembly.fasta (FASTA format)

## When is GraphUnzip useful ?

It is tempting to try to use GraphUnzip on any assembly to improve its contiguity. And you can ! Yet on some assemblies it will not improve the results at all. You can generally know that beforehand by looking at what the assembly graph looks like with the tool [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage/).
GraphUnzip untangles assembly graphs. Thus it likes having messy, tangled graphs as input. Here is an example of an assembly on which GraphUnzip will probably do well:
![tangled graph](https://github.com/nadegeguiglielmoni/GraphUnzip/blob/master/docs/gfa_tangled.png)

On the contrary, some assemblies are very fragmented. For those, GraphUnzip cannot do much, since it cannot reconstitute the missing sequence between two contigs. You might consider using a scaffolder instead. Here is an example of a very fragmented assembly, which cannot be untangled much more:
